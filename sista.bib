@article{Traits,
	Abstract = {Inheritance is well-known and accepted as a mechanism for reuse in object-oriented languages.  Unfortunately, due to the coarse granularity of inheritance, it may be difficult to decompose an application into an optimal class hierarchy that maximizes software reuse. Existing schemes based on single inheritance, multiple inheritance, or mixins, all pose numerous problems for reuse. To overcome these problems we propose traits, pure units of reuse consisting only of methods. We develop a formal model of traits that establishes how traits can be composed, either to form other traits, or to form classes. We also outline an experimental validation in which we apply traits to refactor a non-trivial application into composable units.},

	Abstract = {Browsers are a crucial instrument to understand
				  complex systems or models. Each problem domain is
				  accompanied by an abundance of browsers that are
				  created to help analyze and interpret the underlying
				  elements. The issue with these browsers is that they
				  are frequently rewritten from scratch, making them
				  expensive to create and burdensome to maintain.
				  While many frameworks exist to ease the development
				  of user interfaces in general, they provide only
				  limited support to simplifying the creation of
				  browsers. In this thesis we present a dedicated
				  model to describe browsers that equally emphasizes
				  the control of navigation flow within the browser.
				  Our approach is designed to support arbitrary domain
				  models allowing researchers to quickly define new
				  browsers for their data. To validate our model we
				  have implemented the framework Glamour which
				  additionally offers a declarative language to
				  simplify the definition of browsers. We have used
				  Glamour to re-implement several existing browsers
				  and to explore the creation of new browsers.},
